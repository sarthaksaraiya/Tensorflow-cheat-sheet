# Tensorflow-cheat-sheet
TensorFlow is the second machine learning framework that Google created and used to design, build, and train deep learning models. 
You can use the TensorFlow library do to numerical computations, which in itself doesn’t seem all too special, but these computations 
are done with data flow graphs. In these graphs, nodes represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the data, which 
usually are multidimensional data arrays or tensors, that are communicated between these edges.

You see? The name “TensorFlow” is derived from the operations which neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays or tensors! It’s literally a flow of tensors.

Here is a cheat sheet which contains all the important functions of TensorFlow. There are links present in the cheat sheet which will take you to some python notebooks, 
where you can practice the functions. (Download the sheet to access the links)
